# Attention-Based Vision-Language Models for Captioning

This repository implements the natural language representation of videos and images in the form of captions. The primary objective is to convert visual content from images or videos into meaningful text captions using deep learning models and techniques.

## About the Project

This project focuses on generating captions for both images and videos. Using advanced deep learning models, it can analyze visual data and produce textual representations in natural language. The project aims to integrate video captioning, where the challenge is to generate accurate and contextually rich captions for dynamic scenes.

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Captioning**: Generate human-readable descriptions for videos.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Uses ResNet/VGG for feature extraction.
- **Attention Support**: Optional attention mechanism for improved accuracy.
- **Modular Code**: Easily swap components (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for training models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive development environment for experimenting with models.
- **OpenCV**: Library for video and image processing.
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Libraries for handling data arrays and frames.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed, along with the required dependencies. This project has been tested on **Ubuntu 20.04** but should work on other platforms as well.

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Installation

Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamkrunalrk/generate-image-and-video-captions.git
   cd generate-image-and-video-captions
   mkdir datasets
   ```
   This folder contains the data to train on.

- For downloading Video Data, use the following links:

  - Video Clips: [YouTubeClips](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/clamp/videoDescription/YouTubeClips.tar)

  - Video Captions: [Video Corpus](https://github.com/jazzsaxmafia/video_to_sequence/files/387979/video_corpus.csv.zip)

- Add data in following directory structure:

```
dataset/
  flickr30k_images/
    flickr30k_images/
    results.csv
  msvd_videos/
    msvd_videos/
    video_corpus.csv
```

### Execution

1. Preprocess the videos and train the model for captioning:
   - Use **`image_captioning.ipynb`** for image-based captioning.
   - Use **`video_captioning.ipynb`** for video-based captioning.
   - These notebooks will guide you through the training process, including data loading, model creation, and training steps.

## Models and Techniques

### Pre-trained Models

For video captioning, the project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction from frames and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for generating sequence captions. A typical architecture used is:

1. **CNN (e.g., InceptionV3 or ResNet)**: To extract features from video frames.
2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: To generate captions from the extracted features, handling the temporal sequence aspect of videos.

### Training Details

- **Training data**: The model is trained on large-scale video-captioning datasets (e.g., MSVD, MSR-VTT).
- **Loss function**: Categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification of captions.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for effective training.
